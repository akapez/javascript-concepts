### JavaScript DOM Manipulation
DOM manipulation allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications by modifying the structure, content, and style of web pages.

What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to a part of the document, such as an element, attribute, or text content. The DOM allows programming languages like JavaScript to access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically.

- The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like structure that represents HTML elements as nodes.
- Understand node types like elements (ELEMENT_NODE), text (TEXT_NODE), comments (COMMENT_NODE), and the importance of node properties like nodeType, nodeName, and nodeValue. [Node](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node)
- Recognize that DOM updates are not synchronous: JavaScript execution doesnâ€™t immediately reflect in the rendered DOM.
